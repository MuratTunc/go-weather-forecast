## Start the program
Go under projects directory.
Type _sudo make up_build_ comment from terminal.
After this command, binary files of _Broker_ and _weather_ services will be created.

  ```

Type _make start_ command from terminal. After this command, the front end binary will be created and run.
```
Building front end binary...
cd ../front-end && env CGO_ENABLED=0 /usr/local/go/bin/go build -o frontApp ./cmd/web
Done!
Starting front end
cd ../front-end && ./frontApp
